# MegaLoc
An image retrieval model for any localization task, which achieves SOTA on most VPR datasets, including indoor and outdoor ones.

[Gradio Demo](https://0d7698f8ebc91eea89.gradio.live/) - [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17237) - [Paper on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17237) - [Paper on HF](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.17237) - [Model on HF](https://huggingface.co/gberton/MegaLoc).

### Using the model
You can use the model with torch.hub, as simple as this
```
import torch
model = torch.hub.load("gmberton/MegaLoc", "get_trained_model")
```

For more complex uses, like computing results on VPR datasets, visualizing predictions and so on, you can use our [VPR-methods-evaluation](https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-methods-evaluation), which lets you do all this for MegaLoc and multiple other VPR methods on labelled or unlabelled datasets.

### Qualitative examples
Here are some examples of top-1 retrieved images from the SF-XL test set, which has 2.8M images as database.
